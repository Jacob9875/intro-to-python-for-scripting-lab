# Problem 4: Weather advice
#
# Write a Python script named `weather_advice` that provides clothing advice
# based on weather conditions.
#
# Requirements:
# - The script should prompt the user to enter if it is cold (yes/no).
# - Then, ask if it is raining (yes/no).
# - Use logical operators to determine clothing advice:
#   - If it is cold AND raining, print "Wear a waterproof coat."
#   - If it is cold BUT NOT raining, print "Wear a warm coat."
#   - If it is NOT cold but raining, print "Carry an umbrella."
#   - If it is NOT cold AND NOT raining, print "Wear light clothing."
#
# Hints:
# - Use logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) in your if statements to handle
#   multiple conditions.

def weather_advice():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    cold = input("Is it cold? (yes/no): ")
    raining = input("Is is raining? (yes/no) ")

    is_cold = cold == "yes"
    is_raining = raining == "yes"

    if is_cold and is_raining:
        print("Wear a waterproof coat.")
        
    elif is_cold and not is_raining:
        print("Wear a warm coat.")
        
    elif not is_cold and is_raining:
        print("Carry an umbrella.")
    
    else: 
        print("Wear light clothing")

# Call the function
weather_advice()
