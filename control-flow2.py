# Problem 2: Old enough to vote?
#
# Write a Python function named `check_voting_eligibility` that determines if a
# user is old enough to vote.
# Fill in the logic to perform the eligibility check inside the function.
#
# Function Details:
# - Prompt the user to input their age: "Please enter your age: "
# - Validate the input to ensure the age is a possible value (no negative 
#   numbers).
# - Determine if the user is eligible to vote. Set a variable for the voting
#   age.
# - Print a message indicating whether the user is eligible to vote based on the
#   entered age.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture the user's age.
# - Use `int()` to convert the input to an integer. Ensure that you handle any 
#   conversion errors gracefully. You may need to look up how to do this online.
# - Use a conditional statement to check if the age meets the minimum voting age
#   requirement.

def check_voting_eligibility():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    eligibility = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

    voting_age = 18

    if eligibility < 0:
        print("Age cannot be negative. Please enter a valid age.")
    elif eligibility >= voting_age:
        print("You are eligible to vote")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible to vote yet.")


    # Call the function
check_voting_eligibility()
